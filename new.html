      <div class="first-text">I've been thinking a lot about your thoughtful gesture of wanting to gift me a dress for my birthday. While the idea is incredibly sweet.</div>
      <div class="second-text">
        But taking materialistic things as gifts makes me feel bad and guilty.So can we drop this idea for now where as for the dress I really loved it.
      </div>
      <div class="third-text">I've always admired the way you express yourself, whether it's through your texting I love you or I miss you Daily or putting those songs which reminds you of us</div>
      <div class="fourth-text">
        So, I have a tiny request: instead of a dress, could you write me a love letter?
      </div>
      <div class="fifth-text">
        It doesn't have to be fancy or perfect â€“ just a heartfelt expression of your love and appreciation for our relationship not from some instagram or google.
